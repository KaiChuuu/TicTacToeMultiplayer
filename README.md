# Multiplayer Tic Tac Toe

A simple two-player Tic Tac Toe game built using Python, PyQt5, sockets, and threads. This project was a fun experiment to explore networking concepts by allowing the game to be played on two separate devices over a local network.

## Features

- Two-player gameplay across devices
- Socket-based client-server architecture
- Threaded communication for smooth updates
- PyQt5 GUI for intuitive interaction

## Getting Started

1. Launch Server
2. Launch two Clients and play the game! (Note: if you play remotely, you will need to update the HOST ip for both files)
